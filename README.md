# Rengarenk-Archived
This is the first app that I published to the App Store.
It was approximately three years ago.
I designed this app as a final project for CS193P.
Later I decided to publish it to earn experience.
I earned my first money as software developer thanks to this.
But later I disliked the design, and also didn't wanted to maintain
code or add new features to the app so I removed it from sale.
Now I can publish the code publicly to show it as proof that I can
create complex programs using UIKit.

Game Description

Every level contains couple of words related with description.
Letters that make up the words are color coded and spreaded all over the screen.
You have the finds words using letters that have same color.
If you go to settings and turn on the flying mode, than letters start colliding with each other
using dynamic animator which add extra difficulty and movement to the game.
