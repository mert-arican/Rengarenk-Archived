# Rengarenk-Archived
This is the first app that I published to the App Store.
It was approximately three years ago.
I designed this app as a final project for CS193P.
Later I decided to publish it to earn experience.
I earned my first money as software developer thanks to this.
But later I disliked the design, and also didn't wanted to maintain
code or add new features to the app so I removed it from sale.
Now I can publish the code publicly to show it as proof that I can
create complex programs using UIKit.
